# ComplimentBot
A BlueSky Bot that posts a random compliment whenever ran.

This bot uses [FunAPI](https://github.com/LakhindarPal/my-fun-api).
The triggering of this bot is handled on my own end. So, if you wanna replicate this for whatever reason, you'll need to figure that out for yourself. 

You are welcome to make make pull requests. I'll check em out and merge them whenever I get the chance to.

## Setup
1. Run ```npm i``` to install the dependencies. 

2. Rename ```.env.example``` to ```.env``` and put your Bot's username and password in their related fields.

Do that, and the bot is pretty much ready to use!
